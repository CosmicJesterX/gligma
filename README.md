# Gligma: A Tech Meme Playground 🚀🍻

Gligma is a fun, experimental project combining tech exploration with **absurdity and memes**. Here we build silly scripts, network tools, and crazy system checks that poke fun at real technologies.

## Features
- **Absurd system checks**: Ligma errors, beer supply warnings, and meme-filled pings.
- **Interactive tests**: Run commands and watch your terminal come alive with jokes and memes.
- **Integration with GitHub Actions**: Trigger fun builds that run **Ligma tests** and **CPU jokes**.

## Setup
- Clone the repo
- Run `./install.sh` to install dependencies
- Have fun with random terminal outputs!

## How to Contribute
- Fork the repo and add your own **tech memes** or **absurd network tools**.
- Create an issue for your ideas or fun tests.

## Example

```bash
./ping-test.sh
